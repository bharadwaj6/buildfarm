# Requirements Document

## Introduction

BuildFarm uses Action Cache (AC) and Content Addressable Storage (CAS) to store and retrieve build artifacts. Over time, these caches can become stale or corrupted, or may need to be cleared for maintenance purposes. This feature will provide an API for administrators to selectively or completely flush parts of the Action Cache and Content Addressable Storage, including both in-memory and persistent storage components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Action Cache Flushing

**User Story:** As a BuildFarm administrator, I want to selectively flush parts or all of the Action Cache, so that I can remove stale or corrupted cache entries and ensure build integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator calls the flush AC API THEN the system SHALL provide options to flush the entire Action Cache or specific portions based on provided criteria
2. WHEN an administrator requests to flush Redis-backed Action Cache entries THEN the system SHALL remove the specified entries from Redis
3. WHEN an administrator requests to flush in-memory Action Cache entries THEN the system SHALL clear the specified entries from memory
4. WHEN the Action Cache flush operation completes THEN the system SHALL return a summary of the operation including the number of entries removed
5. WHEN an administrator requests to flush the Action Cache with invalid parameters THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
6. WHEN multiple flush requests are received simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle them in a thread-safe manner

### Requirement 2: Content Addressable Storage Flushing

**User Story:** As a BuildFarm administrator, I want to selectively flush parts or all of the Content Addressable Storage, so that I can reclaim disk space and remove unused artifacts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator calls the flush CAS API THEN the system SHALL provide options to flush the entire CAS or specific portions based on provided criteria
2. WHEN an administrator requests to flush filesystem-backed CAS entries THEN the system SHALL remove the specified files from the filesystem
3. WHEN an administrator requests to flush in-memory LRU cache entries THEN the system SHALL clear the specified entries from the LRU cache
4. WHEN an administrator requests to flush CAS worker map entries in Redis THEN the system SHALL remove the specified entries from Redis
5. WHEN the CAS flush operation completes THEN the system SHALL return a summary of the operation including the number of entries removed and space reclaimed
6. WHEN an administrator requests to flush the CAS with invalid parameters THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
7. WHEN a CAS flush operation is in progress THEN the system SHALL ensure ongoing operations are not disrupted

### Requirement 3: Authentication and Authorization

**User Story:** As a BuildFarm system, I want to ensure that only authorized administrators can flush caches, so that the system remains secure and protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to access the flush API THEN the system SHALL verify the user has administrator privileges
2. WHEN an unauthorized user attempts to access the flush API THEN the system SHALL deny access and return an appropriate error message
3. WHEN a flush operation is requested THEN the system SHALL log the user identity, timestamp, and details of the operation

### Requirement 4: API Design and Integration

**User Story:** As a BuildFarm developer, I want a well-designed and documented API for cache flushing, so that it can be easily integrated with existing admin tools and interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API is implemented THEN it SHALL follow RESTful principles
2. WHEN the API is deployed THEN it SHALL include comprehensive documentation including examples
3. WHEN the API is called THEN it SHALL accept parameters to specify the scope of the flush operation
4. WHEN the API is integrated THEN it SHALL be accessible through the existing admin interface
5. WHEN the API is implemented THEN it SHALL include appropriate rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Requirement 5: Standalone Action Cache Implementation

**User Story:** As a BuildFarm developer, I want to implement a standalone Action Cache component, so that it can be independently tested and maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the standalone Action Cache is implemented THEN it SHALL provide all functionality of the current integrated Action Cache
2. WHEN the standalone Action Cache is deployed THEN it SHALL be configurable independently of other components
3. WHEN the standalone Action Cache is used THEN it SHALL maintain the same performance characteristics as the integrated version
4. WHEN the standalone Action Cache is implemented THEN it SHALL include comprehensive tests

### Requirement 6: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a BuildFarm quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive tests for the cache flushing API, so that I can ensure it works correctly and doesn't cause unintended side effects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cache flushing API is implemented THEN it SHALL include unit tests for all components
2. WHEN the cache flushing API is implemented THEN it SHALL include integration tests that verify end-to-end functionality
3. WHEN the cache flushing API is tested THEN it SHALL be verified under high load conditions
4. WHEN the cache flushing API is tested THEN it SHALL be verified that it doesn't interfere with normal build operations
5. WHEN the cache flushing API tests are run THEN they SHALL verify that flushed data is actually removed from all storage layers
